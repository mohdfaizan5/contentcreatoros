# V1 - going beyond forms like experience


## new features
1. /free-tools/branding - branding section with examples
2. /free-tools/linkedin-carousel-generator




We'll also make a LinkedIn carousel generator that should be easy to make the content and basic like Canva like editing. But I think that these kind of things overcomplicate, it's just like let them be on their own. Maybe we can give some Canva templates for everyone to do all the signal templates, not overcomplicating the things. Maybe this can be used as a blog idea. 


We'll make a section on the left side called as branding. That will help user to make their own stuff and we will show some examples of what branding means like on maybe on LinkedIn carousels or profile banners and the contents they make the videos and everything. So that user come to a conclusion of what is it branding and they can pick their own branding. 

You mentioned "should have a lot of tags like system" - what types of tags are you envisioning? (e.g., platform tags like YouTube/Instagram, content-type tags like Tutorial/Vlog, or status tags?)
> [!NOTE]
> **Tags system deferred to V2** - Initially, we'll keep ideas simple without complex tagging. This keeps the MVP focused and reduces complexity.
